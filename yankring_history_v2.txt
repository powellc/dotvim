A major initiative undertaken by volunteers from the community is welcoming everyone to come tour the new science center at Deer Isle-Stonington High School. Spearheaded by Sunset resident Bill Shaw, the science center seeks to provide DISHS students with a dedicated and high-quality space for performing scientific experiments and inquries. The open house is scheduled for Wednesday, September 8 from 3 to 5 p.m., and everyone is invited.Last month, Shaw sent a newsletter to the community, noting that the project is nearly complete, after contributions from more than 60 people raised more than $56,000. Hurdles such as the necessity of an emergency exit and window in the previously window-less space between two science classrooms have been overcome, and the center is on track to be usable by high school students for the 2010-11 school year. The center features 12 new laboratory tables, new cabinents, whiteboards, and a host of dedicated scientific equipment, which has been carefully cleaned and refurbished to give students the tools they need to perform expeirments. In addition, the fact that the space is isolated from classroom space means projects that take many days, weeks or even months, can be setup and left undisturbed between class periods.,v

erintendent Mark Hurvitt pitched the idea of trying to from a 5-town Alternative Organizational Structure with Surry and the four towns in Union 93 using the same motivator as he did to pitch an AOS between Unions 76 and 93: money. At the Union 93 Joint School Board's August 24 meeting, Hurvitt argued that, with most board members in agreement that Surry should be invited to join the government of the Union and not just purchase services, an AOS would make the most sesne, as it would give all towns except Castine and Surry a chance to recapture penalty money. Penobscot, Blue Hill and Brooksville were, together, penalized approximately $115,000 in state aid for failling to consolidate in January 2009. Castine and Surry were spared the penalty for only the current year because they voted for consolidation.Hurvitt also noted that the action before the Union 93 Board were not binding, and only amounted to the Union 93 towns agreeing to send a proposal to the state to create an AOS with Surry. "We'd know within a week or 10 days whether the state would play ball with a 5-town AOS," explained Hurvitt.Union 93 Board Chairman Joe Spinazola of Castine opened discussion on the issue with a disclaimer that he only wanted to proceed if every board was on board. Blue Hill School Board Chairman Ben Wootten had reservations. He asked what happened to the idea of simply inviting Surry to join Union 93 as a fifth member. Spinazola pointed out that Hurvitt already received legal council that such a move is not possible under the current consolidation law. Wootten argued that unless language in the AOS law requiring "consistent" contracts with teachers and staff could be resolved without substantially increasing school budgets, he could not see a way to approve forming an AOS. "If it's going to cost three times what we would get back from the state, it's a no-go," said Wootten. In the interest of having more time as a board to discuss the issue, Wootten suggested each board hold individual votes at their September meetings regarding whether to send a 5-town AOS proposal to the state.In other business, the board approved a proposal to reduce the central office technology coordinator position from 40 hours per week to 10. The move comes as Matt Jurick, who held the position, recently took a new position as the technology coordinator for the Blue Hill Consolidated School. Hurvitt told the Union 93 Board that he has discussed the situation at length with Jurick, and he has agreed to continue providing limited technology support to the central office for around 5 to 10 hours each week. Hurvitt estimated the change would result in a savings of approximately $32,000.Wootten asked whether the money saved could go towards hiring a curriculum coordinator, who could also assist in finding and applying for competitive grants. Hurvitt said that would be one possiblity, and that he was also thinking about a temporary position to help sort through the policy manuals in each town and get them up to date. The board unanimously approved the reduction in hours for the technology coordinator position, though agreed to sit on the money saved for the start of the school year.Lastly, the board heard from central office secretary Caroline Heller that she has agreed to take on the role of 403(B) plan manager for the Union 93 office. Previously the job was contracted out and paid for by the teachers taking advantage of the plan. Heller said the job is not as complicated as it seemed when the laws governing 403(B) plans changed last year, and she feels comfortable she can handle the new job. Each school board will have to individually approve Heller as manager of the plans at their September board meeting.The next Union 93 Joint Board meeting will be held in Decmeber, though a date has not yet been set.,v
